## Cars are great

Here is some math:

$1 + 1$

When you render this file, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

What a great plot!
