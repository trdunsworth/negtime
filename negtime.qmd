# CAD Time Stamp Analysis

The following analysis is desinged to look at the time stamps related to service calls for the past 13 months and determine the significance of event sequencing and investigate the challenges presented when calls for service are manipulated after the first call closure.

```{r load_dataset}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

df <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\tony.dunsworth\\projects\\negtime\\data\\ItsAboutTime.csv")
```

## Author's Note

The data was harvested from the CentralSquare Enterprise CAD Reporting Database. The two database tables that were queried are Response_Master_Incident and Response_Master_Incident_Ext. These two tables contain all of the time stamps needed for the analysis. For this analysis, the data consists of call information, including the method of call reception, priority number, and the problem type from 01 January 2024 through 31 January 2025. This dataset consists of `{r} nrow(df)` rows prior to any cleaning of adjustments.

## Dataset Creation and Cleaning

The next step is to take the time stamps that are identified in the background as characters (chr) and convert them to timestamps. We will do this using a variation of the `as.POSIXct()` function. After that, the elapsed times are also listed as chr and we need them to be integers. This happens because there are NULL values and when saving the output of the SQL query to a comma-separated values (CSV) file, NULL becomes imprinted as a string. 

```{r convert_timestamps}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

df$ClockStartTime <- as.POSIXct(sub("\\.000$", "", df$ClockStartTime), format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "EST")
df$Time_PhonePickUp <- as.POSIXct(sub("\\.000$", "", df$Time_PhonePickUp), format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "EST")

### Dataset Description

After the cleaning steps that take place behind the scenes, two of the original columns have been dropped because they contained no values. Below is a list of the remaining columns and the data they contain or the time frames they represent. 

::: {.callout-important}
Note that any negative values in the deltas occur when the time for the rightmost variable is earlier than the time recorded for the leftmost variable.

Please note that there should not be, if calls are not re-opened, any delta between a time stamp and its 'Fixed' counterpart.

In the list above, the Steps columns are meant to follow a call from the time the clock starts to the time the clock stops. I've identified a possible 10 step timing chain that wouild allow us to step through the history of a call. There are multiple possible steps for the second step depending on management preferences. Once we have established the chain time wise, then we can use these steps as a tool to investigate specific events and to get better analyses and insights from processes overall. This can also assist in trend analyses. Where there are no entries for some ofthese time points, we may need to create alternative elapsed time points to create our steps. Those decisions are part of this project's goals.

You will note there are some columns duplicated because they are meant to be used for different analyses using the same dataset. Traditionally, we shouldn't have to do this, but I chose to make this distinction for ease of use.

## Data Analysis

### Missing Data

Looking at the dataset, here is a graph of missing data:

```{r missing_data, warn_large_data=FALSE}
#| echo: false

library(naniar)
gg_miss_var(df)
```

As you can see from the graph above, the biggest issues that we see are with TimeFirstUnitDispatchAcknowledged and Time_First_Unit_Assigned with a large majority of the rows where they are absent. While the first showing an acknowledgement is not an issue. I can safely recommend that it be removed and we leave it out of future research work, I am very concerned about the Time_First_Unit_Assigned being so sparse. If we are called on by the City to discuss overall response time, not knowing when we started assigning units to a call presents a large-scale problem for DECC and the City. However, a brief visual inspection does not appear to support the graph's assertion that over 150,000 rows have a missing value.
